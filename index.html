<h1>Red Pandas</h1>
<h3>Red pandas can be easily distinguished by its unique ruddy coat color, which acts like<br>camouflage in the canopy of fir trees where branches are covered with clumps of<br>reddish-brown moss and white lichens. Long, coarse guard hairs cover the entire<br>body and there is a soft, dense, woolly undercoat. Their face is predominantly white<br>with reddish brown tear tracks extending from the eye to the corner of the mouth.<br>These markings could have evolved to keep the sun out of their eyes. Red pandas<br>have long, bushy tails that help give this arboreal species balance. Their tails are<br>marked with alternating red and buff rings.</h3>
<h3>Red pandas are the only Asian carnivores to have dense hair covering their feet; the<br>nearest parallel is the polar bear. Red pandas have five toes that are widely<br>separated and semi-retractable claws. In addition to anal glands and urine, they also<br>use scent glands located between their footpads to mark territory. The scent<br>marking glands on the bottom of red pandas' feet exude a colorless liquid, odorless<br>to humans. Red pandas test the odors using the bottom of their tongues, which has<br>a cone-like structure for collecting the liquid and bringing it close to a gland inside<br>their mouths. They are the only carnivores with this adaptation. Their ankles are<br>extremely flexible and rotate when climbing headfirst down a tree trunk. Red pandas<br>climb well, using trees for shelter, to escape predators and sunbathe in the winter.</h3>
<h3>They have large round heads and short snouts with large pointed ears. They have<br>extremely robust dentition in contrast with other carnivores their size, but they have<br>a simple carnivore stomach despite their predominantly leaf-based diet. They share<br>the giant panda's thumb: a modified wrist boneâ€”that is used to help grasp bamboo when feeding.</h3>
